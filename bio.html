				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<div class="col-1-2">
					<p style="color: #ffffff;">Arturo Martinez is a Mixing Engineer and Music Producer currently based in Orlando, Florida. His focuses in production are Blues, Rock and RnB, while his mixing ranges from Pop to Metal. He attended the Berklee International Network program in San Francisco de Quito University, Ecuador where he studied Music Production and Engineering for three years. While there he learned everything he knows about music theory before deciding it would be better to finish his studies in the United States.</p>
					<p style="color: #ffffff;">Arturo lives for the passionate arts. Music has been a part of his life since the very second he could remember listening to it for the first time. He bought his first record, by The Police, at the age of seven, and he was playing by the age 11 when his cousin gifted him his first classical guitar. After listening to music for so long (he usually listens to music for at least six hours a day, he realized that there is a lot more beyond a music artist than a CDs surface and became interested in Audio Engineering and Music Production.</p>
					<p style="color: #ffffff;">When he composes or engineers for someone’s production, he tries not create a signature sound but he instead works for the music. He’d rather create what the song is asking for. He polishes and expands what is already there to bring the most out of it. He believes that there is something that makes the music a lot better when he gives it what it needs rather than forcing the music to take a specific path. It feels more natural that way. Arturo has worked with two bands before. In a band named Verbod, he played as main guitar, worked as composer and had the job of arranger. Verbod made 10 original songs and went their separate ways after two years.</p>
					<p style="color: #ffffff;">His second band, Escape From the Machinery, featured Arturo as one of the two guitars, and a co-composer and co-producer with another band member. While working with them, Escape From the Machinery composed four songs. One song was put out as a single, and the rest were recorded as demos. Arturo moved to Florida during the recording and ended his career in the band. Outside of the band scene, he has recorded a jingle in Spanish for a chocolate company, Crunch. He’s worked as an audio engineer assistant and as a recording engineer for 2 years and is currently freelancing as a mix engineer.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p style="color: #ffffff;">His love of art brings on a constant thirst for knowledge. He continually tries to better himself by reading articles about microphones, watching videos on mixing tech or music production, learning about Photoshop, studying about luthiers*, and continually keeping up with the advancing arts world. He does this not only because he loves doing it, but also because it helps him improve and always do his best at everything he loves.</p>
